    "question": "Context: 27. The said section 200(2) reads as follows;\nany case, a Court of law is within its rights to give directions that will ensure compliance with  its  orders  and  rulings.  Of  course,  nowhere  in  the  writ  is  such  a  relief  sought. Nonetheless, we note that in the motion paper, the Respondents prayed that the Court grants any relief that the Court deems meet. Indeed, the Court of Appeal is permitted by Rule 31 of the Court of Appeal rules to make any interim order that the Court below is  authorized  to  make  or  grant  and  shall  have  full  jurisdiction  over  the  whole proceedings as if the proceedings had been instituted and prosecuted in the Court of Appeal as though it were the Court of first instance. Thus, issuing out directives to the Regional Police Command to ensure compliance with its orders cannot be said to be extra-legal especially in this case where orders of the Court have been made as far back as in June 2022 but have been disregarded by the Appellants who continue to operate the businesses of the Plaintiffs without lawful authority. Why is issuing directives to the Regional Police Command considered within legal bounds according to this passage?",
    "answer": "Issuing such directives cannot be deemed extra-legal because previous orders have been disregarded, and the court has authority under Rule31 to ensure compliance with its rulings."

His Lordship Justice Anin Yeboah JSC in the case of 18TH JULY LIMITED v YEHANS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED [2012] 1  SCGLR  167  established  the  conditions  that  an  Applicant  must  satisfy  in  order  to warrant an order of interlocutory injunction from a trial court. He states as follows:\n'Even though it is discretionary, we are of the view that a Trial Court in determining interlocutory application must consider \u2026Firstly, whether the case of an applicant is not frivolous and has demonstrated that he had legal or equitable right, which a court should protect.  Secondly,  the  court  is  also  enjoined  to  ensure  that  the  status  quo  is maintained so as to avoid any irreparable damage to the applicant pending the hearing of the matter. And thirdly, the trial court ought to consider the balance of convenience and should refuse the application if its grant would cause serious hardships to the other party.
